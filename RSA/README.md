# Structure of Code
- The file rsa_keys.txt just contains the info of the public and private keys for the user. The program is not connected to the file
- Two scripts contain the decryption and Encryption code, and a third script combines the two.
- The name of the scripts are self-explanatory
- The Message to be Encrypted must be written in Message.txt
- The Encryption program creates a file CipherText.txt containing the encrypted message
- The Decryption program creates a file DecipherText.txt containing the decrypted message
- Both the encryption and decryption programs use the same pair of keys that is provided in rsa_keys.txt
