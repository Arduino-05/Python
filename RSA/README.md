None

# Structure of Code
- The file rsa_keys.txt just contains the info of the public and private keys.
- Two scripts contain the decryption and Encryption code, and a third script combines the two.
- The name of the scripts are self-explanatory
- Both the encryption and decryption programs use the same pair of keys that is provided in rsa_keys.txt

# About
- The file rsa_keys is not connected to the program. It is for the user/developer
- The Message to be Encrypted must be written in Message.txt
- The Encryption program creates a file CipherText.txt containing the encrypted message
- The Decryption program creates a file DecipherText.txt containing the decrypted message

# Misc
- For more information on the working of code, please refer to how RSA encrytion works
- The information can be found in the 'Operations' section of the wiki page [RSA(cryptosystem)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
