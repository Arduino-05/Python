# Structure of Code
1. The file rsa_keys.txt just contains the info of the public and private keys for the user. The program is not connected to the file
2. Two scripts contain the decryption and Encryption code, and a third script combines the two.
3. The name of the scripts are self-explanatory
4. The Message to be Encrypted must be written in Message.txt
5. The Encryption program creates a file CipherText.txt containing the encrypted message
6. The Decryption program creates a file DecipherText.txt containing the decrypted message
7. Both the encryption and decryption programs use the same pair of keys that is provided in rsa_keys.txt
